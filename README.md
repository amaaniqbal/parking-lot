# parking-lot
This is an OOP implementation of a real life parking lot with edge case handling.

Please feel free to create Issues if you find a bug somewhere or send a Pull Request if you wish to improve the existing code/add a new feature. :)

## Setup

Store the project locally. Then traverse to the root of the directory using

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder parking_lot
$ cd parking_lot
```

## Run

Execute the following instruction one by one to run the code.

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder bin where UNIX executable are stored
$ cd bin
```

```sh
# Compile the Source Code using the following instruction. Before running this make sure you have all the requirements installed.
$ ./setup
```

```sh
# Finally Run the project by executing the below instruction. This takes the file stored in `functional_spec/fixtures` as input by default. You can also remove the file name and use the command prompt only for interactive workflow. 
$ ./parking_lot
```

```sh
# For using the command prompt only, its better to run the following command
$ ./main
```

## Requirements

```sh
g++ 7.3.0 
```
